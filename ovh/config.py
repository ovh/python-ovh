"""
The straightforward way to use OVH's API keys is to embed them directly in the
application code. While this is very convenient, it lacks of elegance and
flexibility.

Alternatively it is suggested to use configuration files or environment
variables so that the same code may run seamlessly in multiple environments.
Production and development for instance.

This wrapper will first look for direct instanciation parameters then
``OVH_ENDPOINT``, ``OVH_APPLICATION_KEY``, ``OVH_APPLICATION_SECRET`` and
``OVH_CONSUMER_KEY`` environment variables. If either of these parameter is not
provided, it will look for a configuration file of the form:

.. code:: ini

    [default]
    ; general configuration: default endpoint
    endpoint=ovh-eu

    [ovh-eu]
    ; configuration specific to 'ovh-eu' endpoint
    application_key=my_app_key
    application_secret=my_application_secret
    consumer_key=my_consumer_key

The client will successively attempt to locate this configuration file in

1. Current working directory: ``./ovh.conf``
2. Current user's home directory ``~/.ovh.conf``
3. System wide configuration ``/etc/ovh.conf``

This lookup mechanism makes it easy to overload credentials for a specific
project or user.
